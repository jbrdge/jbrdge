# Hi, I'm Jacob Breckenridge 👋



DevOps engineer & data enthusiast with a background in **mathematics, machine learning, and creative visualization**.  

- **BA in Comprehensive Mathematics** – University of Arizona (2008)  

- **MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering** – University of Arizona (2019)  



I build projects that connect **data workflows, visualization, and cloud infrastructure**. Recently, I’ve focused on automation that makes systems easier to manage, more reliable, and harder to break.

### Customer Churn Prediction


This is a learning project, I used AI assisted templates for code to review MLOps Concepts. I performed the planning of the project as if I were a project manager creating milestones, issues, PRs, actions, labels, code reviews, etc. It is an ongoing and I plan to expand it as I learn. It is a churn prediction pipeline starting with SQL cleaning scripts, moving into Python feature engineering and modeling, and finishing with a Tableau dashboard for results visualization. The repo is structured like a real-world product build — with `.github/` templates, issues, milestones, and branching history — to highlight not just the analysis but also the **Git workflow and project management practices** behind it.

### LEGO Dataset Dashboard

This project focuses on **data storytelling and visualization**.  

Using the Kaggle LEGO dataset, I designed Tableau dashboards to explore theme popularity, set complexity, and color usage across LEGO history. A lightweight PHP web interface supports the data, and the project could be containerized with Docker for portability.  

Unlike the churn repo, this one emphasizes **product delivery (interactive dashboards)** rather than a workflow-heavy pipeline — providing a complementary showcase of my skills.

### AWS Cost Analyzer



This project highlights my **FinOps and cloud cost analysis** skills.  

I used AI to generate a synthetic AWS billing dataset (services, accounts, environments, teams) and used Python for preprocessing and cost breakdowns. The results were visualized in Tableau dashboards to surface KPIs like MTD spend, service-level costs, and team allocations.  

The project demonstrates my ability to connect **cloud infrastructure knowledge with data analysis** to support cost optimization — a bridge between my DevOps background and data-focused career path.

### Visualizations

This repo highlights my work in **data and signal visualizations** using both Python and [Processing.org](https://processing.org/).  

It includes experiments like **K-Nearest Neighbor variations in Python** as well as a wide range of **generative animations in Processing** — from sinusoidal waves, knot curves, and polygon spirals to gravity simulations, graph algorithms, and artistic distortions.  

The collection blends **data science, algorithmic thinking, and creative coding**, showcasing how technical models can be transformed into engaging visual experiences.
