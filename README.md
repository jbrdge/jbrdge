# Hi, I'm Jacob Breckenridge 👋

I'm a DevOps engineer pivoting into data-focused roles (Data Analyst / Data Engineer / FinOps).  
This profile highlights projects that showcase both **workflow discipline** and **data storytelling**.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

| Project | Focus Area | Workflow Signals | Product Output |
|---------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| **[Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/jbrdge/churn-prediction)** | Full data pipeline & workflow | `.github/` templates, issues, milestones, branching history | SQL cleaning → Python modeling → Tableau dashboard |
| **[LEGO Dataset Dashboard](https://github.com/jbrdge/lego)** | Visualization & product delivery | Lightweight Git, minimal issue/PR workflow | SQL cleaning → PHP web interface → Tableau dashboards |
| **[AWS Cost Analyzer](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacob.breckenridge3515/viz/AWSCostDashboard-Sample1Month/AWSCostAnalysisAug2025)** | Cloud cost analysis (FinOps) | Python scripts with clean repo structure | Synthetic AWS cost dataset → Power BI/Tableau dashboards |

### 📊 Customer Churn Prediction
This project demonstrates a **full end-to-end data workflow**.  
I built a churn prediction pipeline starting with SQL cleaning scripts, moving into Python feature engineering and modeling, and finishing with a Tableau dashboard for results visualization.  
The repo is structured like a real-world product build — with `.github/` templates, issues, milestones, and branching history — to highlight not just the analysis but also the **Git workflow and project management practices** behind it.

### 🧱 LEGO Dataset Dashboard
This project focuses on **data storytelling and visualization**.  
Using the Kaggle LEGO dataset, I designed Tableau dashboards to explore theme popularity, set complexity, and color usage across LEGO history. A lightweight SQL + PHP web interface supports the data, and the project could be containerized with Docker for portability.  
Unlike the churn repo, this one emphasizes **product delivery (interactive dashboards)** rather than a workflow-heavy pipeline — providing a complementary showcase of my skills.

### ☁️ AWS Cost Analyzer
This project highlights my **FinOps and cloud cost analysis** skills.  
I generated a synthetic AWS billing dataset (services, accounts, environments, teams) and used Python for preprocessing and cost breakdowns. The results were visualized in Power BI and Tableau dashboards to surface KPIs like MTD spend, service-level costs, and team allocations.  
The project demonstrates my ability to connect **cloud infrastructure knowledge with data analysis** to support cost optimization — a bridge between my DevOps background and data-focused career path.
